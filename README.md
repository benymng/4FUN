# 4FUN: Personal Trainer Device

prototypeFinal and ParseGraphDatabase.py are the 2 main files for demoing the prototype. The first gets wifi connection between arduino and computer, and sends data to IP address. The second parses the data and graphs accelerometer data and uploads it onto a MongoDB database.

Our current challenges include wiring, wifi speed, and python requests.
